# Machine Learning Integration

This project involves training a machine learning model using a dataset to make predictions or provide recommendations. The model will be integrated into a web application to offer real-time predictions to users. Additionally, the project includes monitoring the model's performance and updating it with new data to ensure it remains accurate and effective over time.

- __Model Training__: Train a machine learning model using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Save the trained model for later use.
- __Prediction Function__: Develop a function that loads the trained model and generates predictions based on new input data.
- __Web Application Integration__: Create a web application using Flask or Django and integrate the prediction function to provide real-time predictions to users.
- __Model Monitoring__: Implement monitoring to track the accuracy and performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- __Model Updating__: Periodically update the model by retraining it with new data and deploying the updated model to the web application.
